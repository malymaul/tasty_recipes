    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>While Philadelphia has its Philly cheesesteak, NYC's bodegas boast another hoagie roll sandwich known as Chopped Cheese or Chop Cheese for short. Toasted hoagie rolls, stuffed with chopped ground beef burger, caramelized onions, and gooey melted American cheese. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>Ground Beef</li>
       <li>Seasoning</li>
       <li>Hoagie</li>
       <li>Cheese</li>
       <li>Condiments</li>
       <li>Veggies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice yellow onion, slice tomatoes, and shred the lettuce. Set aside until needed.</li>
        <li>Spread Â½ tablespoon of butter on the inside of each hoagie roll. Grill in a large skillet until golden brown. Plate until needed.</li>
        <li>Divide the meat into four 6-ounce portions and shape each portion into an oval. Season generously on both sides with salt and pepper. Place one portion into a hot cast-iron skillet and smash with the back of a spatula (similar to smash burgers). Cook over medium high heat for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the flattened patty to the other side and top with a quarter of the diced onions. Now begin chopping the burger patty as you mix in the onions. Continue doing this for a few minutes until the meat has crispy edges and the onions are grilled.</li>
        <li>Top meat with 2 American cheese slices. Turn off the heat and allow the cheese to melt.</li>
        <li>Slather mayo and ketchup on the toasted hoagy roll. Add the patty and top with shredded lettuce and sliced tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and serve.</li>
    </ol>
